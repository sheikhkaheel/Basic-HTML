    ANCHOR TAG & HTML <br><br>
    <p class="style">
        From early 1950-1990s internet was under some educated people,at that time there were static text pages in order
        to operate with these text pages people have to remember the path/URL of these text pages,which was written in a
        journal. It was a complicted and time consuming process,but in 1990s Tim Burner Lee introduced a language called
        HTML.Html (hyper text markup language) was same as xml language both were markup languages but the difference
        between them was html introduced a tag called anchor tag .Anchor tag was assoicated with a action (event) that
        made the content written with in the tag clickable due to which we were able to connect two pages using this
        tag.This gave the idea of www (world wide web).
    </p>
    FORM TAG <br><br>
    <p class="style">
        Problem was arised in the static wesites of e-commerse,people who want to buy from the e-commerce web sites,they
        used to spent a lot of time in chosing the product but in order to buy the product they had to contact the
        customer in contact section of the websites but the line used to be already occupied by the another customer
        beacuse of this they used to lose thier customers.This problem was raised in UN.So form tag was introduced form
        tag is a container/wrapper it has no value without the html controls/widgts because of form tag websites became
        dynamic i.e first in client server architecture server used to serve to the client that is websites were static
        read only but after form tag was introduced client could also write to a server.Form tags consists of few
        important attributes (action="") its tell where to send the data,it can take any value (method="") it tells how
        to send the data,it takes few predefined value such as "get" "post" "dialog" "del" "patch" etc these are https
        but in Html we use only "get,post,dialog", it is a request .Request has two type header and body,in get method
        header part contains data while body is null and vice-versa is for post method when we use method attribute then
        we also have to use another attribute "enctype" is take two values i.e "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" and
        "multipart/form-data",if we have to upload a file then we have to used (method="POST" and
        enctype="multipart/form-data").
    </p>
    INPUT TAG <br><br>
    <p class="style">
        Html/Form controls (input tag).Input tags can be written seperatly also other then inside the form tag.There is
        a general convention for all input tags that all name attributes of input tag should have unique value except
        some of the tag eg: input type="radio"
    </p>
    BOM(Browser Object Model) <br><br>
    <p class="style">
        Browser can't talk directly with the operating system to excess hardware.Its uses interface (Application Program
        Interpreter) to communicate with the operating system,API's contains method to communicate with operating system
        after communicating with operating system it communicates directly with Browser API's.
    </p>
    </p>
    Compiler and Interprater <br><br>
    <p class="style">
        C,C++,C#,java have compiler engine.It is used to translate source code to operating system.It doesn't exeute
        code line by line but is executes whole chunk of code by creating .exe extention file i.e it is in the form of
        0s an 1s.The executable code will only run on same platform in which the code has been compiled i.e compiler is
        platform(machine) dependent. <br>
        JavaScript,Python have interpretar engine.It executes code line by line i.e no executable file is created the
        code gets directly executed line by line which makes it platform interdependent.
    </p>
    Java Script <br><br>
    <p class="style">
        A problem came in the submition of form tag as it was validated from the server i.e when the user used to submit
        the form.He had to fill it again from the start beacuse user may have forgotten/written wrong form details
        because of this user faced problem while writting form.At that time Netscape was popular browser company
        therefore the CEO of Netscape Company told his manager(Brendan Eich) to deal with this problem.So he created a
        language in ten days called Livescript to communicate with the DOM,so that form could be validated before
        submiting.In order to offically use this language they had to get the permission from the WC3 head Tin Burner
        Lee.WC3 approved it and script tag was created to use livescript in Html.Netsape did a licensed agreement with
        the Sun company and changed livescript to javascript.Javascript got popluar but at that time Microsoft was the
        Tech Giant also created a language called vbscript and jscript because of this in script tag type attribute was
        added to use both of the languages.As Operating system was from Microsopt Netscape knowed that their is no
        future for javascript so they sold it offically to Ecma NGO.Javascript got offically registered in UN because of
        this javascript got popular and was installed in all browsers.JavaScript is a mixture of languages

        Identifiers <br>
        its a name that contains alphabits,numbers,underscore,dollar etc <br><br>
        Variables are name given to a memory location.All variables are identifiers but all identifiers are not variables
        eg :- var num; & num1 where num is a variable while num1 is a identifier <br>
        Rules for writting variables <br>
        1. varaible name should start with alphabits <br>
        2. Its case sensitive i.e var x; and var X; are different <br>
        3. _ and $ can be only used in variable name <br>
        4. you can't use number in start of varible name <br><br>
        Data types <br>
        1. Number (-1,0,1,9.0) 2. String ("helo","1") 3. Boolean(T,F) 4. Null (null) 5. Undefined (undefined) <br><br>
        Types of operators <br>
        1. Arthimatic Operator <br>
        It consists of +,-,*,/,%,** etc <br>
        Binary opertor it is a operator which has two hands that means two operants eg :- 1+2 '+' is a binary operator 1&2 are operants. <br><br>
        2. Logical operator <br>
        It consists of logical operators such as OR (||), AND (&&), NOT (!). <br>
        Its used to perform logical operations.It consists of two operants linked with logical operator.It gives true or false as result<br><br>
        3. Comparison operator <br>
        Its used to compare one or more numbers <br>
        Its consists of comparison operators such as <,>,<=,>=,==,!+,===,!== .Comparison operation produces true or false result. <br>
